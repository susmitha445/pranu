<p>Time travel is the concept of movement between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space by an object or a person, typically with the use of a hypothetical device known as a time machine. Time travel is a widely recognized concept in philosophy and fiction. The idea of a time machine was popularized by H. G. Wells's 1895 novel <mark>The Time Machine</mark>.<br>It is uncertain if time travel to the past is phys-ically possible. Forward time travel, outside the usual sense of the perception of time, is an extensively observed phenomenon and well-understood within the framework of special relativity and general relativity. However, making one body advance or delay more than a few milliseconds compared to another body is not feasible with current technology.Traveling to an arbitrary point in spacetime has very limited support in theoretical physics, and is usually connected only with quantum mechanics or wormholes.<br>Some theories, most notably special and general relativity, suggest that suitable geometries of spacetime or specific types of motion in space might allow time travel into the past and future if these geometries or motions were possible.As for backward time travel, it is possible to find solutions in general relativity that allow for it, such as a rotating black hole.</p>

<!--There are known to be solutions to the equations of general relativity that describe spacetimes which contain closed timelike curves, such as GÃ¶del spacetime, but the physical plausibility of these solutions is uncertain.Many in the scientific community believe that backward time travel is highly unlikely. -->
<!--Any theory that would allow time travel would introduce potential problems of causality.The classic example of a problem involving causality is the "grandfather paradox": what if one were to go back in time and kill one's own grandfather before one's father was conceived? Some physicists, such as Novikov and Deutsch, suggested that these sorts of temporal paradoxes can be avoided through the Novikov self-consistency principle or to a variation of the many-worlds interpretation with interacting worlds.-->
